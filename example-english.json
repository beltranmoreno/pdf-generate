  "body": "After a detailed clinical evaluation and imaging studies, it has been determined that Mr. Nicolás Moreno de Alborán's injury is more complex than initially expected. The findings indicate a tear in the semimembranosus muscle accompanied by damage to the tendon insertion site.\n\nGiven the extent of the injury, the patient will require a period of rest for several weeks, followed by a structured rehabilitation program including:\n\n- Radiofrequency therapy utilizing the Indiba device\n- Low-impact exercise on the AlterG treadmill\n- Soft tissue therapy\n- Isometric strengthening exercises\n- Progressive eccentric and concentric muscle training\n\nUpon completion of this rehabilitation protocol and full functional recovery, Mr. Moreno de Alborán may gradually return to tennis activity under medical supervision.\n\nBest regards,",
